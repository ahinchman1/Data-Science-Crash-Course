# Data-Science-Crash-Course
As part of my continued research for automated testing, I've created a compilation of online resources from colleagues, data scientists, QA testers, and more that I believe is thorough to get started on machine learning and testing.  This list is a work in progress, and I expect to add more resources over time.

## Getting started with Python
Python is lays down the foundation in a language that is more popular with data science.  Most data science materials out there is taught in Python - even if you're familiar with the language, getting a solid foundation in Python syntax will help you understand the intricasies of working with a dynamic language in scripting.

 In addition to the fundamental data structures, understanding Pandas and data frames and translating those into other languages becomes challenging, the fundamental building blocks of AI.  Haven't found materials for that yet but will update when I get the chance.
